The Virtual Doctor Appointment Booking Form is a web application that allows users to book virtual sessions with doctors. This form-based tool provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their basic information, select a doctor, choose a location, and specify the desired appointment date and time.

Key Features:

1.Form Validation: The form includes validation for the email field, ensuring that a valid email address is entered before submission. Invalid emails are highlighted, and the submit button is disabled until a valid email is provided.
2.Real-time Feedback: As users type their email address, real-time feedback is provided to indicate whether the entered email is valid or not.
3.Booking Submission: Once the form is filled out, the user can submit the booking. The form data, including full name, email, doctor selection, location, and date, is sent as a JSON payload to a specified endpoint for further processing.
4.Success and Error Messages: The application provides success and error banners to inform users about the status of their booking submission.
5.Clearing the Form: Users have the option to clear the form and start over by clicking the "Clear" button.
